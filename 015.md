# [WP-M1] getRewards() can be triggered by external parties which will result in the rewards not be tracking properly by the system

## Summary

`ConvexRewardPool#getReward(address)` can be called by any address besides the owner themself.

## Vulnerability Detail

The reward tokens will only be added to the assets list when `getReward()` is called.

If there is a third party that is "helping" the `account` to call `getReward()` from time to time, by keeping the value of unclaimed rewards low, the account owner may not have the motivation to take the initiative to call `getReward()` via the `AccountManager`.

As a result, the reward tokens may never get added to the account's assets list.

## Impact

If the helper/attacker continuously claims the rewards on behalf of the victim, the rewards will not be accounted for in the victim's total assets.

As a result, the victim's account can be liquidated while actual there are enough assets in their account, it is just that these are not accounted for.
