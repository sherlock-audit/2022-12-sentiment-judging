# [WP-M2] `ETH` should be a constant as it must be `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`

## Summary

`ETH` on `StableSwap2PoolEthController` must be `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`, therefore it should not be configurable.

## Vulnerability Detail

Curve's ETH address is fixed as `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`, so that it should also be fixed in `StableSwap2PoolEthController.sol`.

The current implementation is allowing the `ETH` address to be configured on deployment.

This is also inconsistent with [StableCurveEthOracle.sol](https://github.com/sentimentxyz/oracle/blob/40cfd1e95a531e4c88e082e651efae7fc16cdefa/src/curve/StableCurveEthOracle.sol#L37).

## Impact

A wrong configuration can result in malfunction of `StableSwap2PoolEthController`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change to: 

```solidity
address constant ETH = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;
```
