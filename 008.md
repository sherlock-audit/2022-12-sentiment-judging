# Curve Factory pools do not support the `minter()` interface

## Summary
Some pools (factory) in Curve do not support the `minter()` interface

## Vulnerability Detail
Factory pools in curve fuse the token & pool functionality into one contract. There is no concept of a separate token contract, that has the `minter()` function, which returns the pool address. This can be problematic in `StableCurveEthOracle` because  of the following code in `getPrice()`
```solidity
ICurvePool pool = ICurveLP(token).minter();
```
This will always revert when it is called for a factory pool's token.

## Impact
This limits the protocol's usability since it does not support a common type of Curve pool, so it should be of Medium severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add handling for factory pools, for example a try-catch block on the `minter()` call.
