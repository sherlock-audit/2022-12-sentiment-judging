# Missing checks on `BOOSTER` in `ConvexBoosterController`

## Summary
Parameter addresses in the constructor are the base of the contract workflow, they miss check for 0 address, if wrongly assigned, they can not be changed again and redeploy would be needed.

## Vulnerability Detail
If wrongly assigned a value of `address(0)` to `BOOSTER`, contract won't work as expected. 

## Impact
`canDeposit` would fail when using `IBooster(BOOSTER).poolInfo(pid);`. Gas would be wasted on deployment and need of redeploy to fix this function failing. Reputational damage can also occur depending on how fast this is found
