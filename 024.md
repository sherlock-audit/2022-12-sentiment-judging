# Booster integration: `canDeposit` should conisder the case where a particular  pool is shutdown

## Summary

Current booster integration does not account for one of the case where the pool could be shutdown

## Vulnerability Detail

    function canDeposit(bytes calldata data)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
    {
        (uint pid, ) = abi.decode(data, (uint, uint));
        (address lpToken, , address rewardPool, ,) = IBooster(BOOSTER).poolInfo(pid);

`canDeposit` collects the lpToken and rewardPool addresses. But it does not check whether the pool is shutdown or not.


Boos't pool infor struct is

    struct PoolInfo {
        address lptoken;
        address token;
        address gauge;
        address crvRewards;
        address stash;
        bool shutdown;
    }

Last argument `shutdown` used to update the status of shutdowned.


## Impact

Using the shutdowned pool could harm the protocol

## Recommendation

Check if the pool is shutdown. if so, don't use that pool.
