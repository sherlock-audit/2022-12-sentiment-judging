# ConvexBoosterController.sol : incorrect reward pool address collected in `canDeposit`

## Summary
For booster,  `canDeposit` function returns the `lpToken` and `rewardPool` addresses.

The collected `rewardPool` is not of the `crvRewards`

## Vulnerability Detail
Here how the token address collected from booster.

        (address lpToken, , address rewardPool, ,) = IBooster(BOOSTER).poolInfo(pid);

The booster structure is,

    struct PoolInfo {
        address lptoken;
        address token;
        address gauge;
        address crvRewards;
        address stash;
        bool shutdown;
    }

the third argument is `gauge`, current implementation return this gauge as reward pool


## Impact
Incorrect reward pool is used which is not correct method. reward collection will not work.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the correct `rewardpool` address.

Try to write all the return value from the` poolInfo` and collect the correct address to return


      (address lpToken, address token, address gauge, ,address rewardPool, address stash ,bool bVar) = IBooster(BOOSTER).poolInfo(pid);
