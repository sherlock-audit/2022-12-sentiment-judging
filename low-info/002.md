# Return values of `transfer()` not checked

## Summary

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. You arent checking this return. This parameter needs to be checked for success.

Take in mind that some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. You arent checking this return. This parameter needs to be checked for success.
Take in mind that some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Impact
Tokens that fail on transfer returning a false will be interpretate by the code as a success.
Tokens thtat don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, will create an unexpected behaviour.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-sentiment/blob/main/protocol/src/core/Account.sol#L167-L169
```solidity
            try IERC20(assets[i]).transfer(
                toAddress, assets[i].balanceOf(address(this))
            ) {} catch {}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `Helpers.safeTransfer`

Change
```solidity
            try IERC20(assets[i]).transfer(
                toAddress, assets[i].balanceOf(address(this))
            ) {} catch {}
```
to
```solidity
            try Helpers.safeTransfer(
                assets[i], toAddress, assets[i].balanceOf(address(this))
            ) {} catch {}
```
