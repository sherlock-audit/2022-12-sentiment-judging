# Tokens not actually owned by an account are added to the account

## Summary
In `ConvexRewardPoolController` some functions calls are allowed that will add tokens to the account but the account won't receive any token.
## Vulnerability Detail
- In `canWithdraw`, if amount=0, then tx is successfull and the 2 rewards tokens + LP are added to tokensIn even if no token is received
- In `canGetReward`, rewards can be claimed for another account. In this case the rewards tokens are added even if the caller account receives no tokens. Also, If the account calls for itself, the rewards contract can send only one or none of the two tokens to the account, but both tokens are always added.
## Impact
tokens are added to the account but are not sent to the account

## Recommendation
In `canWithdraw` if amount = 0 , then return false and add no tokens.
