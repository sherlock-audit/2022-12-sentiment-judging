# `Oracle` or `WETH` can not work as intended in `StableCurveEthOracle`

## Summary
Parameter addresses in the constructor are the base of the contract workflow, they miss check for 0 address, if wrongly assigned, they can not be changed again and redeploy would be needed.

## Vulnerability Detail
If wrongly assigned a value of `address(0)` to `WETH` or `oracleFacade`, contract won't work as expected. 

## Impact
Oracle and therefore `getPrice` function can not work or return a wrong WETH value if wrongly assigned address 0.

Gas would be wasted on deployment and need of redeploy to fix this function failing. Reputational damage can also occur depending on how fast this is found
