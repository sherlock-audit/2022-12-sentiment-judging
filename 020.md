# Curve LP oracle manipulation with read only reentrancy in pool's `get_virtual_price`

## Summary
`Stable2CurveOracle` call to `get_virtual_price()` returns a deflated price when it is reentered after calling the Curve pool's `remove_liquidity` function. This allows an attacker to liquidate healthy accounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

`get_virtual_price` gives the value of an LP token relative to the pool stable asset by dividing the total value of the pool by the `totalSupply()` of LP tokens:
```vyper
@view
@external
def get_virtual_price() -> uint256:
    """
    @notice The current virtual price of the pool LP token
    @dev Useful for calculating profits
    @return LP token virtual price normalized to 1e18
    """
    D: uint256 = self.get_D(self._xp(self._stored_rates()), self._A())
    # D is in the units similar to DAI (e.g. converted to precision 1e18)
    # When balanced, D = n * x_u - total virtual value of the portfolio
    token_supply: uint256 = ERC20(self.lp_token).totalSupply()
    return D * PRECISION / token_supply
```
In the Curve pool function `remove_liquidity` when ETH is withdrawn, `raw_call()` allows the caller to reenter after the coin balances have been updated, but before the LP tokens are burned, so during the callback a reentrant call to `get_virtual_price()` will return a deflated value.

```vyper
@external
@nonreentrant('lock')
def remove_liquidity(_amount: uint256, min_amounts: uint256[N_COINS]) -> uint256[N_COINS]:
    """
    @notice Withdraw coins from the pool
    @dev Withdrawal amounts are based on current deposit ratios
    @param _amount Quantity of LP tokens to burn in the withdrawal
    @param min_amounts Minimum amounts of underlying coins to receive
    @return List of amounts of coins that were withdrawn
    """
    _lp_token: address = self.lp_token
    total_supply: uint256 = ERC20(_lp_token).totalSupply()
    amounts: uint256[N_COINS] = empty(uint256[N_COINS])

    for i in range(N_COINS):
        _balance: uint256 = self.balances[i]
        value: uint256 = _balance * _amount / total_supply
        assert value >= min_amounts[i], "Withdrawal resulted in fewer coins than expected"
        self.balances[i] = _balance - value
        amounts[i] = value
        if i == 0:
            raw_call(msg.sender, b"", value=value)
        else:
            assert ERC20(self.coins[1]).transfer(msg.sender, value)

    CurveToken(_lp_token).burnFrom(msg.sender, _amount)  # Will raise if not enough

    log RemoveLiquidity(msg.sender, amounts, empty(uint256[N_COINS]), total_supply - _amount)

    return amounts
```
An attacker can exploit this by deploying a contract that does this:
1. get a large amount of ETH through a flashloan
2. `add_liquidity` with the ETH borrowed
3. Call `remove_liquidity`: during the callback `raw_call()` the Curve Oracle LP price is deflated due to large difference between Pool value and LP total supply.
   During callback
   1. call `AccountManager.liquidate()` on all accounts holding the Curve LP token that do not pass the health check anymore (The Oracle LP token price is less than the actual price so collateral will be underestimated). Attacker profits from the liquidation permiums.
4. Execution after `raw_call()` in `remove_liquidity` resumes, LP tokens are burned
5. Repay loan + fee

## Impact
Cruve LP Oracle manipulation will lead to attacker being able to liquididate accounts holding curve LP and profit from the liquidation premiums.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-sentiment/blob/main/oracle/src/curve/StableCurveEthOracle.sol#L58-L73

```solidity
    function getPrice(address token) external view returns (uint) {
        ICurvePool pool = ICurveLP(token).minter();

        address coin;
        uint price;
        uint minPrice = oracleFacade.getPrice(WETH);
        for(uint i; i<N_COINS; i++) {
            coin = pool.coins(i);
            if (coin != ETH) {
                price = oracleFacade.getPrice(coin);
                minPrice = (price < minPrice) ? price : minPrice;
            }
        }

        return minPrice.mulWadDown(pool.get_virtual_price());
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A solution implemented by many protocols is to add a call to a pool non reentrant function inside the oracle, like this:

```diff
    function getPrice(address token) external view returns (uint) {
+       uint256[2] calldata amounts;
+       ICurvePool(token).remove_liquidity(0, amounts);
        uint price0 = oracleFacade.getPrice(ICurvePool(token).coins(0));
        uint price1 = oracleFacade.getPrice(ICurvePool(token).coins(1));
        return ((price0 < price1) ? price0 : price1).mulWadDown(
            ICurvePool(token).get_virtual_price()
        );
    }
```

Note that the call to `remove_liquidity` will succeed but won't remove any liquidity if the pool is not reentered. It will revert if the pool is reentered because of the `@nonreentrant('lock')` decorator on `remove_liquidity`.
