# Missing checks on `ETH` in `StableSwap2PoolEthController` can lead to unexpected paths on the flow

# Missing checks on `ETH` in `StableSwap2PoolEthController` can lead to unexpected paths on the flow
## Summary
Parameter addresses in the constructor are the base of the contract workflow, they miss check for 0 address, if wrongly assigned, they can not be changed again and redeploy would be needed.

## Vulnerability Detail
If wrongly assigned a value of `address(0)` to `ETH`, contract won't work as expected. 

## Impact
Different paths in 4 functions would not work as intended if wrongly assigned 0 value. Gas would be wasted on deployment and need of redeploy to fix this function failing. Reputational damage can also occur depending on how fast this is found
