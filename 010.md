# User can't get actual Convex Reward due to failed to call Convex `getReward()`

## Summary

User can't get / claim Convex Reward due to failed to call Convex's `getReward()` because of invalid function signature

## Vulnerability Detail

The pull request (https://github.com/sentimentxyz/controller/pull/50) is using  
```solidity
    /// @notice getReward(address)
    bytes4 GET_REWARD = 0xc00007b0;
```
only one parameter, address.

meanwhile, on the Convex repository, the valid function are `getReward(address _account, bool _claimExtras)` (0x7050ccd9), or `getReward()` (0x3d18b912) without any parameter
https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L263

this difference will make the `getReward` call failed, thus user can't get their reward balance correctly, so loss of reward.

***I separate this issue from my Convex Deposit because this one will have effect user can't get their reward --> loss of claimable asset for user, thus high impact (meanwhile the Convex Deposit is only preventing user to call the deposit, no loss of asset)***

## Impact

Failed to call `getReward()` function will not returning the correct reward for user, so loss of reward for user

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace the function signature with the correct one
