# checking of pool shutdown parameter is missing in ``ConvexBoosterController::canCall``


## Summary
Calling ``canCall`` from ``ConvexBoosterController`` with the ``deposit`` signature can return wrong information about a queried pool that has been shutdown. 

In case a pool is shutdown ``canCall`` will return ``(true,...)`` but it should return ``(false,...)`` so the next call to ``deposit`` will not fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside ``canCall`` the ``poolInfo`` function of the ``BOOSTER`` contract is used to query information for the given pool id.
Beside the information for the input and output tokens we get also information about if the pool has been shutdown.
In a case a pool has been shutdown the [deposit](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf403c135812408bfbe8713b5a23a04b3d48aae31#code) call will fail

```solidity
    // inside somePool.deposit(...)
    function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount) public returns(bool){
        require(!isShutdown,"shutdown");
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        require(pool.shutdown == false, "pool is closed"); 
```

the main part that will revert such ``deposit`` call is ``require(pool.shutdown == false, "pool is closed");``

## Impact
Calling ``ConvexBoosterController::canCall`` should return the correct information about the success of the ``deposit`` call. In a case of a closed/shutdown pool it will not show the correct information for the next call to succeed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the queried pool has been shutdown like this:

```diff
    function canDeposit(bytes calldata data)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
    {
        (uint pid, ) = abi.decode(data, (uint, uint));
-        (address lpToken, , address rewardPool, bool ,) = IBooster(BOOSTER).poolInfo(pid);
+        (address lpToken, , address rewardPool, bool isShutDown,) = IBooster(BOOSTER).poolInfo(pid);
        address[] memory tokensIn = new address[](1);
        tokensIn[0] = rewardPool;

        address[] memory tokensOut = new address[](1);
        tokensOut[0] = lpToken;

-        return (true, tokensIn, tokensOut);
+        return (!isShutDown, tokensIn, tokensOut);
    }
```
